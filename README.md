# code-challenges

Throughout Code Fellows 301 course, my partner and I will complete a set of daily code challenges. Each set will contain up to ten problems.

The daily challenges will be posted by the instructor at the end of lecture every day. I plan to focus on this task with my partner every day after class until 6 p.m., completing as much as possible during this time, then I will complete the remainder of the challenges on my own, as needed.
